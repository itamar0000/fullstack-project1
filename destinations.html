                            Rome, the capital of Italy, is a city rich in history, culture, and timeless beauty. Known as “The Eternal City,” it was once the heart of the powerful Roman Empire, leaving behind iconic landmarks such as the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon. Walking through its streets feels like traveling back in time, with ancient ruins standing alongside Renaissance art and Baroque architecture. Rome is also home to Vatican City, the world’s smallest independent state and the spiritual center of the Catholic Church. Beyond its history, Rome enchants visitors with its lively atmosphere, delicious cuisine, and charming piazzas that capture the essence of Italian life.                        </p>
